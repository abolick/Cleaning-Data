Cleaning-Data
=============
Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each              activity and each subject.
  
Running run_analysis.r
  1.  Save the run_analysis.r file in a folder on your local drive.  
  2.  Set this folder as you working directory using setwd().
  3.  Run source("run_analysis.r").  You now have your tidy data saved as a text file in your working directory.
